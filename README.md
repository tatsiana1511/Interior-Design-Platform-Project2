## Why
Inspired by the love for my home and many creative interior designers that know how to create beautiful spaces.

---

## About the application
The goal of the platform is to **connect** clients and interior designers.

A **client** should be able to see the designer's information and completed projects and to connect.

A **designer** can sign up to become a member of the platform and add the projects.
